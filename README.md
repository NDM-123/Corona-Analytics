# FaceDetectionApp

This app was made to identify faces of people and in the future ill add the option to compare between faces and if there will be a match the sqaure will change in to green,ive also added an option to work with mySql Data base for maybe future purposes.

The name CoronaAnalytics came from a Hackathon i competed in,trying to find a solution for Covid-19 virus. 

A few problems needs taking care of:
1)The user needs to grant camera permission to the app.
2)The app works at best only when phone is rotated horizontally.
3)Because a lot of calculations are made the camera image doesnt move smoothly.
