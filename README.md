# FaceDetectionApp

This projecct is a part of a Hacakathon that is meant to find a solution to Covid-19.

The app is meant to connect with a government database which stores peoples image that are supposed to be in qurantine or Covid-19 positive.
The apps camera scans faces in real-time and compares with the government database,if there is a match the app notiyfys by email/whatsapp/calls the police in order to prevent from the person to keep wandering around and spread the virus... 

A few problems needs taking care of:
1)The app works at best only when phone is rotated horizontally.
2)Because a lot of calculations are made the camera image doesnt move smoothly.
3)The comapring face isnt active yet.
